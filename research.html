          <h3>Key Parameters in Common Envelope Evolution</h3>

            Binary systems can be comprised of any combination of astrophysical
            objects, from stars and planets to neutron stars and black holes. In
            a post-LIGO-detection age, we endeavor to explain the existence of
            close binaries that are able to merge on a timescale less than the
            age of the universe, as well as the rate of such mergers. Though the
            start-to-finish evolution of these systems in general is of
            interest, it is practical to investigate phases of evolution that
            offer the possibility of being observed; the traditional formation
            channel for close binaries, in which a common envelope (CE) phase
            dramatically reduces the separation of a pre-existing binary system,
            offers that possibility.</p>
          <p>The onset of the CE phase occurs when the expanding envelope of one
            of the stars in the binary extends to the orbit of the other star
            (or planet, black hole, etc.) and engulfs it (a → b). Due to
            gravitational interactions between the embedded object and the
            envelope material, a drag force acts on the former and it eventually
            plunges in toward the core of the expanding star (b). Depending upon
            the amount of energy the embedded object can deposit into the
            envelope material and the timescales on which this energy can be
            transported throughout the envelope, the CE phase may end in either
            the ejection of the envelope and a surviving binary comprised of the
            embedded object and the remaining core at greatly reduced separation
            (c), or a merger of the two with envelope intact (d).</p>
          <p>My work focuses on key physical parameters that describe the CE
            phase for a range of initial systems, giving insight on the inspiral
            phase and the final system configuration. This includes looking at
            the impact of envelope structure on drag forces and expected
            accretion, as well as inspiral and energy transport timescales,
            leading to exciting insights about CE as a formation channel for
            some of the most exotic astrophysical configurations in the
            universe.</p>
